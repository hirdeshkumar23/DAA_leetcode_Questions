🔍 Searching

704. Binary Search
Given a sorted array nums and a target target, return its index if found, else -1. Must run in O(log n).
Example: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9 → 4

35. Search Insert Position
Return the index if target is found in sorted nums. If not, return the index where it should be inserted.
Example: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2 → 1

34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
Return the starting and ending position of target in nums. If not found, return [-1, -1].
Example: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8 → [3,4]

33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Search target in rotated sorted array (no duplicates). Return index if found, else -1.
Example: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0 → 4

81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
Similar to above, but duplicates allowed. Return true/false.
Example: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0 → true

153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
Find the minimum element in rotated sorted array.
Example: nums = [3,4,5,1,2] → 1

162. Find Peak Element
Find a peak element (greater than its neighbors) and return its index.
Example: nums = [1,2,3,1] → 2

875. Koko Eating Bananas
Given piles of bananas and hours h, find the minimum eating speed k so Koko eats all in time.
Example: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8 → 4

1552. Magnetic Force Between Two Balls (similar to GFG Aggressive Cows)
Place balls in baskets to maximize minimum magnetic force.
Example: position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3 → 3

74. Search a 2D Matrix
Search target in a 2D matrix (rows & columns sorted). Return true/false.
Example: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target=3 → true

🔄 Sorting

912. Sort an Array
Sort array using quicksort/mergesort/heap sort.
Example: nums = [5,2,3,1] → [1,2,3,5]

56. Merge Intervals
Merge overlapping intervals.
Example: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]] → [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

57. Insert Interval
Insert a new interval into a sorted interval list, merge if needed.
Example: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5] → [[1,5],[6,9]]

2545. Sort the Students by Their Kth Score
Sort students’ scores (matrix) by the kth column in descending order.
Example: score = [[10,6,9,1],[7,5,11,2],[4,8,3,15]], k=2 → [[7,5,11,2],[10,6,9,1],[4,8,3,15]]

1561. Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get
From piles of 3, pick coins optimally to maximize coins.
Example: piles = [2,4,1,2,7,8] → 9

905. Sort Array By Parity
Put all even numbers before odd numbers.
Example: nums = [3,1,2,4] → [2,4,3,1]

1913. Maximum Product Difference Between Two Pairs
Pick two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) to maximize (a*b - c*d).
Example: nums = [5,6,2,7,4] → 34
